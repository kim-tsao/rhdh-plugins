# DCM workspace packages

- **app** – Full Backstage frontend app (catalog, techdocs, search, scaffolder, DCM plugin). Run with `yarn workspace app start`.
- **backend** – Full Backstage backend (catalog, auth, scaffolder, techdocs, search, DCM backend plugin). Run with `yarn workspace backend start`.

From the workspace root, `yarn start` runs both app and backend concurrently.
